# Android 11 Tree for fog

I have decided to adapt the tree to Android 11 for fog in my free time, based on Jabiyeff's work (Credits to him). For now the tree is not complete and works on permissive, so some bugs can be expected. Plus, the tree work on spes rebranding to him. Also it's just for fun and learning purposes, because I am a complete noob.

### What works?
* Boots
* Selinux enforcing 
* RIL
* WiFi
* Mobile Data
* VoLTE
* Bluetooth
* Sound/Vibration
* Fingerprint
* Camera
* Flashlight
* GPS
* SDCard

### What doesn't work, or isn't tested
* Brightness is a bit low than usual (In some roms)
* NFC is broken
